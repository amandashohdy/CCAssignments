Write a program that produces the output shown below. Your implementation must use a two-dimensional array (hint: use an n x 2 string array) to store and
process student IDs and student test answers and should be based on the following information:  

Your Math professor needs help in grading a True/False test. The students’ ID and test answers are stored in a file and your program should read a single
input string (do not prompt) which is the file name containing this test score data.  The first entry in the file contains the answer key for the test in
the form: 

TFFTFTFFTFTTFTFTFFTT

All other entries in the file consist of a student ID, followed by white space, followed by a student’s responses and a new line.  For example, the entry: 

ABC543 TFTFTFTT_TFTFTFFTTFT  

indicates that the student ID is ABC543 and the answer to question 1 is True, the answer to question 2 is False, and so on. This student did not answer
question 9, so there is an underscore ('_') in position 9. The exam has twenty questions and the class will never have more than 30 students (any entries
beyond this in the input file should be ignored). 

Each correct answer is awarded two points, each wrong answer gets one point deducted, and no answer gets zero points.  The lowest possible total point 
score is zero. Write a program that processes the test data from the input file. The output should be a table header followed by the student’s ID, followed 
by their answer, followed by their % score, followed by their letter test grade as illustrated below. Assume the following grade scale: 90% - 100% A; 80% - 
89.99% B; 70% - 79.99% C; 60% -69.99% D; and 0% - 59.99% F. After outputting all the student data, output the student IDs with the minimum and maximum 
percent scores and average percent score for the entire test (note: min and max should be the first encountered if there are duplicate % scores as there 
are in the example below).

Write and use the following two functions (with prototypes above your main function and implementations below your main function) to help with the 
processing:
double getPercentScore(const string ANSWERS, const string KEY); // return the percent score 
                             // based on student answers and the key

char getGradeScore(const double PERCENT);    // return the letter grade based
                            // the percent score



Screen INPUT (user)/OUTPUT (program) – should be formatted as follows (example using the provided testScores.txt file)

StudentID Answers               % Score Grade
ABC123    TFTFTFTTTTFTFTFFTTF_     95.0     A
AAB000    TFTTTFTTTT_TFTFFT_FT     82.5     B
ZZT090    TTTFFFTTTFFFTTTFFF__     30.0     F
DOZ003    TFTFTFTTTTFFFFFFFFFF     62.5     D
DDC123    _FTFTFTTTTFTFTFFTTFT     95.0     A


Min score is  30.0% for Student ID ZZT090
Max score is  95.0% for Student ID ABC123
Average   is  73.0%
